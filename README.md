# im selling this source code + with other stuff  
- add my discord if interested: skeng#9524

## what are the benifits with buying the source?
- the source code is not public version it will be a completely undetected injector + driver along with a custom mapper allowing you to bypass vangaurd + faceit blocking methods 

- dump games + the game pdb ( some games dont work )
- you can use detours + minhook
- dump offsets for all titles + auto sig maker
- choose what injection type
- IAT dumper
- Anti-Cheat Emulator ( allowing you to do anything you want practically )
